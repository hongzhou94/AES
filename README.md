# AES 128/192/256

### This is an extension of the AES 256 project given by Prof. Bill Young in CS361 at UT Austin.

#### This implementation will handle AES 128/192/256 encryption and decryption. Keys must be in text files formatted as 128/192/256 bits of hexadecimals, with no spaces. Plaintext files for encryption and ciphertext files for decryption must be in text files formatted as hexadecimals with no spaces. Each line must contain exactly 128 bits.


### Invoke with:

##### "java AES 1 keyfile plaintext 2 3"

##### 1, 2, and 3 are flags/parameters that must be given on the command line.

##### Flag 1: e / d for encryption/decryption
##### Flag 2: v / n for verbose/non-verbose
##### Flag 3: 128 / 192 / 256 for selecting desired key length
